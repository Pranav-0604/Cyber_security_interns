## 7. Spelling and Grammar Error Analysis

### Purpose of This Check
Phishing emails often originate from non-professional or automated sources that **fail to follow proper grammar or spelling conventions**. Legitimate companies like Microsoft maintain a high standard of language quality. Errors in spelling, punctuation, or sentence structure are strong red flags indicating fraud or spoofing.

### Observed Issues in the Email

After reviewing the email body from the `.eml` file, the following issues were identified:

| Sentence/Line                                           | Issue Type               | Explanation                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| "We detected something unusual about a recent sign-in." | None                     | Grammatically correct.                               |
| "Please let us know whether or not this was you."       | None                     | Correct structure.                                   |
| "If this wasnâ€™t you, someone else might have access..." | Apostrophe usage         | Acceptable but could confuse some readers.           |
| "Microsoft will never ask for your password via email." | None                     | Standard warning phrase.                             |
| "Click the button below to secure your account."        | None                     | No grammatical issue.                                |

No blatant **spelling** errors or obvious **grammatical mistakes** were found in the email text.

### Conclusion

While this phishing email was crafted with **minimal to no grammar/spelling errors**, the presence of other red flags (such as a spoofed domain, mismatched URL, and suspicious content) still strongly indicates a **malicious intent**.

### Recommendation

Do not rely solely on language quality to determine the legitimacy of an email. Always verify:
- Sender's address
- URLs and links
- Unexpected content
- Attachments or urgency in tone
