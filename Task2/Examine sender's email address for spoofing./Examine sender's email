|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Is domain official/trusted?          |  `outlook.com` is a valid Microsoft domain |  Trusted       |
| Is display name misleading?          |  Not available                             |  Inconclusive  |
| Does reply-to differ from sender?    |  No difference observed                    |  Legitimate    |
| Was the email expected?              |  Generic security alert, no context given  |  Suspicious    |

## Notes

- While `outlook.com` is a genuine domain, attackers can **still spoof it**.
- Absence of display name and message body limits verification.
- Microsoft usually sends alerts from addresses like:
  - `account-security-noreply@accountprotection.microsoft.com`

---

##  Conclusion

Even though the domain is valid, the message is **suspicious** due to:
- Lack of context
- No personalization
- No message body content
